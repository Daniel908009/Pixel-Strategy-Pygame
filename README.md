# Pixel-Strategy-Pygame
Hello and welcome to my third pygame <br>
<h2>IDEA</h2>
the original idea was to make a sandbox with randomly generated nations on a map, this is I think a possible idea in pygame <br>
<h2>REALIZATION</h2>
as it turned out, I dont have enough skills to make all of it work properly, the basic idea works, however the reset button/function is a nightmare, and so was my attempts at making some kind of algorithm  <br> to hopefully make the game run smoother. Both failed as I dont have enough skills and it would take literal centuries before I would make it work. <br>
<h2>ENDING</h2>
because of the issues I have mentioned above, I will try to submit this version to the arcade, and just move on to something else. Maybe one day I will have enough skills to finish it. <br>
