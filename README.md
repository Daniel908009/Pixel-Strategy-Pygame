# Pixel-Strategy-Pygame
Hello and welcome to my third pygame
IDEA
the original idea was to make a sandbox with randomly generated nations on a map, this is I think a possible idea in pygame
REALIZATION
as it turned out, I dont have enough skills to make all of it work properly, the basic idea works, however the reset button/function is a nightmare, and so was my attempts at making some kind of algorithm to hopefully make the game run smoother. Both failed as I dont have enough skills and it would take literal centuries before I would make it work.
ENDING
because of the issues I have mentioned above, I will try to submit this version to the arcade, and just move on to something else. Maybe one day I will have enough skills to finish it.
